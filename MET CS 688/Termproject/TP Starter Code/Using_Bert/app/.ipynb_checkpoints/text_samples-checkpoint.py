         Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that
         maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.[1] It infers a
         function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.[2]
         In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object
         (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). 
         A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, 
         which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the 
         algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires 
         the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a

Overview and Recommendations. Evaluation.
Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) in all patients with chest pain (Strong recommendation). 
For patients with acute chest pain and suspicion of unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), see Acute coronary syndromes or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 
In stable patients with known or suspected CAD, perform a history and physical and consider selected blood tests. Order ECG stress testing in stable patients with at least intermediate pretest probability of CAD based on cardiovascular risk prediction who are able to exercise with interpretable ECG and order nuclear myocardialperfusion imaging (MPI) or echocardiography if the ECG is uninterpretable or the patient is unable to exercise (Strong recommendation). 
Cardiac stress testing is not recommended for routine screening of asymptomatic men or women (Strong recommendation). 
Perform coronary angiography in stable patients suspected of having CAD if:. 
there is high likelihood of severe CAD based on clinical characteristics and noninvasive testing if benefits may outweigh risks (Strong recommendation). 
there is presumed stable CAD, unacceptable ischemia on guideline-directed medical therapy, and candidacy for revascularization (Strong recommendation). 
Consider coronary angiography in stable patients suspected of having CAD if:. 
clinical characteristics and noninvasive testing indicate a high likelihood of severe ischemic heart disease in candidates for revascularization (Weak recommendation). 
stress testing is contraindicated or results of stress testing are inconclusive and there is a high likelihood that coronary angiography results will inform therapeutic options (Weak recommendation). 
stress testing results are of unacceptable quality but are negative despite high clinical suspicion of CAD and there is a high likelihood that coronary angiography results will inform therapeutic options (Weak recommendation). 
Do not perform coronary angiography in patients without known CAD who are:. 
at low risk based on clinical characteristics without any prior noninvasive testing (Strong recommendation).
asymptomatic with no ischemia on noninvasive testing (Strong recommendation).

ARTICLE = """ New York (CNN)When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York.
A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.
Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared "I do" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other.
In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her "first and only" marriage.
Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of "offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree," referring to her false statements on the
2010 marriage license application, according to court documents.
Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam.
On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further.
After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective
Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.
All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.
Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted.
The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney\'s Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security\'s
Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called "red-flagged" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali.
Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.

disc_herniation = """Spinal disc herniation.
Spinal disc herniation is an injury to the cushioning and connective tissue between vertebrae, usually caused by excessive strain or trauma to the spine. 
It may result in back pain, pain or sensation in different parts of the body, and physical disability. 
The most conclusive diagnostic tool for disc herniation is MRI, and treatment may range from painkillers to surgery. 
Protection from disc herniation is best provided by core strength and an awareness of body mechanics including posture.
When a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an intervertebral disc allows the soft, central portion to bulge out beyond the damaged outer rings, the disc is said to be herniated. 
c herniation is frequently associated with age-related degeneration of the outer ring, known as the annulus fibrosus, but is normally triggered by trauma or straining by lifting or twisting. 
Tears are almost always posterolateral (on the back sides) owing to relative narrowness of the posterior longitudinal ligament relative to the anterior longitudinal ligament. 
A tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing inflammation, which can result in severe pain even in the absence of nerve root compression. 
Disc herniation is normally a further development of a previously existing disc protrusion, in which the outermost layers of the annulus fibrosus are still intact, but can bulge when the disc is under pressure. 
In contrast to a herniation, none of the central portion escapes beyond the outer layers. Most minor herniations heal within several weeks. 
Anti-inflammatory treatments for pain associated with disc herniation, protrusion, bulge, or disc tear are generally effective. 
Severe herniations may not heal of their own accord and may require surgery.
The condition may be referred to as a slipped disc, but this term is not accurate as the spinal discs are firmly attached between the vertebrae and cannot "slip" out of place.

doc_pyoderma = """ 
Background. 
Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, neutrophilic inflammatory dermatosis, characterized by painful necrotic skin ulceration.
More than half of patients with pyoderma gangrenosum have an associated systemic condition, most commonly inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis). About 1%-5% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease will develop pyoderma gangrenosum. Other reported associated conditions include rheumatologic arthritis, malignancy, neutropenia, infection, auto-inflammatory syndrome, or associated immunodeficiency.
Most commonly, pyoderma gangrenosum develops on the lower extremities, often at the site of a minor trauma, but it can occur at any site, including at stomal and surgical sites. Pathergy, or the triggering or worsening of the skin lesion due to external trauma, is classic for pyoderma gangrenosum.
Evaluation. 
Suspect pyoderma gangrenosum in patients who present with a painful, rapidly enlarging bullous or ulcerating skin lesion, especially with a history of inflammatory bowel disease.
Consider pyoderma gangrenosum in patients without known systemic disease who present with a progressive, painful cutaneous ulceration that is unresponsive to antibiotics and usual wound treatment, and/or is triggered by trauma or worsened with debridement.
Typically, pyoderma gangrenosum will appear as a necrotic and hemorrhagic ulcer with a raised, violaceous or erythematous border and a surrounding halo of erythema.
Consider a deep elliptical incisional biopsy of the lesion's edge and encompassing subcutis to rule out other causes of ulceration, including infection, vasculitis, and malignancy; as well as to confirm neutrophilic infiltrate characteristic of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Consider lab testing based on individual clinical risk, history, and physical exam findings to rule out associated systemic diseases. Consider a work-up for inflammatory bowel diseases (see also Crohn disease in adults or Ulcerative colitis in adults).

Breast cancer in women. 
This malignancy of the breast tissue is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women worldwide.
Background.
Breast cancer is a malignancy of the breast tissue and is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women worldwide.
Early or operable breast cancer is considered potentially curable and includes stage I-IIB and some stage IIIA cancers, specifically T3, N1 tumors.
Noninflammatory locally advanced inoperable breast cancer is considered potentially curable and includes stage IIIA-C breast tumors with the exception of some stage IIIA, specifically T3, N1 tumors.
Inflammatory breast cancer is a rare, aggressive subtype of locally advanced breast cancer characterized by a substantial area of breast skin that is red in color, warm, and thickened or swollen (referred to as peau d'orange).
Advanced (metastatic) breast cancer encompasses disease that has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes and is either de novo stage IV (metastatic at the time of initial diagnosis) or a metastatic recurrence. Common sites of metastases include bone, liver, lung, and brain.
Risk factors for breast cancer include genetic causes, increased age, reproductive history and hormone exposure, lifestyle factors, medical history, and radiation exposure.
Women with breast cancer may present with breast abnormalities detected during screening, without any other signs or symptoms. Common signs and symptoms of breast cancer include palpable breast mass, axillary mass, nipple discharge, skin changes on breast or nipple, asymmetric thickening or nodularity, breast pain, or signs and/or symptoms due to metastatic disease.
The 5-year survival after diagnosis of breast cancer is 99% for women with localized disease, 85% for women with regional spread, and 27% for women with distant metastases in the United States; in addition, women with estrogen receptor positive cancers treated with endocrine therapy have a 13%-41% risk of recurrence 5-20 years after diagnosis. Factors affecting prognosis include tumor and disease characteristics, age, response to therapy, race and ethnicity, and body mass.
Evaluation.
Diagnosis is based on examination of the breast and axillary lymph nodes with clinical exam and imaging, and confirmed by the pathological assessment of biopsy.
Perform imaging including either or both diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound (Strong recommendation); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of breast may also be used in specific circumstances. Recommendations for specific imaging tests vary based on presentation.
Pathological assessment of breast is generally performed using core needle biopsy, preferably with ultrasound or stereotactic guidance (Strong recommendation); also perform ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy of suspicious lymph nodes (Strong recommendation).
Consider testing to assess for distant metastatic disease in patients with inoperable breast cancer and in symptomatic or high-risk patients with operable breast cancer including blood tests, chest computed tomography (CT), abdominal ultrasound or abdominal with or without pelvic CT with contrast or magnetic resonance imaging, bone scan, or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (Weak recommendation).
