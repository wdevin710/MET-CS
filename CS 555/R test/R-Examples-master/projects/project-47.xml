<projectDescription>
Heart disease is a very common disease for human beings.
And heart disease is possible at any age.
In order to see if there is any relationship between the serum cholesterol and the age of the cardiac, the heart disease data from Cleveland database was examined.

<dataDescription>
  The original dataset is from the Cleveland database about the heart disease.
  https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
  It was extracted from Kaggle. The data contains 14 attributes and 303 observations.
  To clean up the data for this project, I extracted only two columns: age and chol and removed the outliers. Age column is the age of every patient and chol column is the serum cholesterol (in mg/dl) of every patient. And I wrote the new data frame in a new csv file called heart_cleanup.csv.
  Read the data set using

<researchQuestion>
Is there a linear association between the serum cholesterol (in mg/dl) and the age of the patient, use alpha =0.05?
</researchQuestion>


<conclusion>
  There appears a very weak linear relationship between age and serum cholesterol of the patient.
  That is, the older a patient, the higher serum cholesterol they will be.
  However, since the correlation coefficient is 0.1895562, which is very small, the relationship between age and serum cholesterol of the patient is very weak.
  In addition, because this is a very small part of the whole data of Cleveland database, the result will be more precise if the dataset is larger.
