<researchQuestion>
Since Titanic is a very specific word so I went with it. However, it came out too many results and so I added survival rate into the search bar and this is the best one I found.

So the result we received from calculating and analytics of the prediction of the survival rate of the Titanic had the accuracy rate of 82.12291% which is a success for this test.
