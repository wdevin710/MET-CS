<projectDescription>
  The research scenario for the following dataset is to predict the insurance charges based on age, sex, region, body mass index, number of children and smoking status.
  We will use simple linear regression to find out if there’s an association between dependent and independent variables in this model.
  We will use one-way analysis of variance to compare group means.

Medical Cost Personal Dataset

The dataset that we will analyze in this assignment is dataset that describes medical costs of people in the US based on the following factors:

Age - age of primary beneficiary
BMI – insurance contractor gender – female or male
Children – number of children covered by health insurance
Smoker – smoking status – yes or no
Region – beneficiary’s residential area in the US – northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest
Charges – individual medical costs billed by health insurance

The dataset has been reduced to 500 participants.

<researchQuestion>
Calculate the least squares regression equation that predicts insurance charges from age.
Then, separate simple linear regression that calculates charges from bmi.
Formally test whether age is a predictor associated with insurance charges at the alpha = 0.05 level.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  Based on the plot we made, we saw the highest correlation was between age and charges.
  Using simple linear regression, we got: for each additional age insurance charges would be higher by $285.48 per person.
  We were 95% confident that true values were between 217.5421 and 353.4237.
  12% of the variability in charges was explained by age.
