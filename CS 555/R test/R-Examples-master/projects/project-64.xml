<dataDescription>
  The dataset was found in Kaggle.com. it consists of 400 instances and 9 variables. The parameters included are:
  1. Serial No.
  2. GRE Scores (out of 340)
  3. TOEFL Scores (out of 120)

  6. Letter of Recommendation Strength (out of 5)
  7. Undergraduate GPA (out of 4)
  8. Research Experience (either 0 or 1)
  9. Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1)
  I kept GRE Scores, Undergraduate GPA and Chance of Admit by cleaning the data.

<researchQuestion>
Is there a linear relationship between chance of admit and GRE Score and Undergraduate GPA? (at the alpha = 0.05)
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  Reject H0 since F statistic >=3.02.
  We have significant evidence at the alpha = 0.05 level that βGRE.Score beta_GRE.Score ≠ 0 and/or beta_CGPA ≠ 0
  There is evidence of a linear association between chance of admit and GRE score and undergraduate GPA.
