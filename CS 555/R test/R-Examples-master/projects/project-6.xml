<projectDescription>
  We want to find out that if the temperature is related/affected by the precipitation.
  So we download the weather data from 2019.1.1 to 2019.2.28 of Boston

<dataDescription>
  My data is about the weather from 2019.1.1 to 2019.2.28 in Boston
  There are two columns of my data.
  The first column is the daily average temperature(â„ƒ),and the second
  column is True/False that if the day has precipitation.

  The data is download from the website above. And I calculate the average temperature .

<researchQuestion>
We would like to know that if the temperature is related to the precipitation.
If so, what kind of relationship do they have?
</researchQuestion>


<conclusion>
  First, we calculate the correlation coefficient between temperature and precipitation,
  the result is 0.33, which indicates there is a little positive relationship between temperature and precipitation.
  Then, we divide the temperature into two groups(high,low) by their mean and calculate the correlation coefficient.
  The result is 0.28, which indicates the precipitation has no relationship with the temperature in degree(if high/low).
