<projectDescription>
This mini project describes data about people who travelled Titanic.
As we know very few survived, there are certain group of people that survived more likely than others.
The factors could be age, sex or class people were travelling etc.
So by performing analysis, tests on the data with respect to the factors mentioned above we can figure out what people should consider before travelling again,
if titanic was ever to travel again in the same path someday.

<dataDescription>
  The dataset we used is the titanic.csv data available in the following link:
  (https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets/tree/master/Datasets).
  This data has the following columns:
  1.	Total passengers (here 888 passengers)
  2.	Name of the passengers
  3.	Age of the passengers
  4.	Sex of the passengers
  5.	Column to say if passengers survived or not
  6.	The class in which the passengers travelled
  7.	Ticket number of the passengers
  8.	Fare of the tickets

<researchQuestion>
To perform analysis of variation on the factors effecting survival like Age, Sex and Class.
Perform a logistic regression with sex as the only explanatory variable.
Find what is the odds ratio for sex and the associated 95% confidence interval based on the model in your summary.
Also find what is the c-statistic for this model.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
Based on data analysis on main effects using the Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression,
we can estimate that if the Titanic vessel were to set sail again, then on an average,
there would be more survivors from the upper class, more survivors who are women and there is no significant effect of Age.
