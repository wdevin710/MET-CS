</dataDescription>

<researchQuestion>
Is there a linear association between age and resting blood pressure, using alpha=0.05?
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>

And there is evidence of this linear association between age and resting blood pressure.
Only 7% percent of variability in the resting blood pressure could be explained by the age.
