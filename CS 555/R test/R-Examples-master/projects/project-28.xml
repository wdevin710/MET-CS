<projectDescription>
This data set contains measurements of 250 men from BYU Human Performance Research Center. Percent of body fat is a health indicator,
but percent of body fat is difficult to measure and is often costlyï¼Œ such as requires special machinery, expertise.
</projectDescription>

<dataDescription>
  This dataset has 250 men. There was one outlier as it relates to body fat (i.e., had 47.5% body fat).
  This was removed in the final analysis, and therefore there were only 249 men utilized in this regression analysis.
  The columns are as follows. Density is a result from Percent of Body Fat, which will not be part of the regression analysis.
  Pct.BF is an accurate reading of the percentage of body fat an individual has.
  Age is measured in years. Weight is measured in pounds.

<researchQuestion>
   Based on factors that are more easily, inexpensively measurable (i.e., age, weight, height, and other body measurements), what is a predictive model for percent of body fat?
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
A model can be built for men that can provide an estimate of percent of body fat utilizing data and measurements from other men.
The key variables to consider are Age, Neck, Abdomen, and Wrist but also likely Waist as other variables may have significant difference.
