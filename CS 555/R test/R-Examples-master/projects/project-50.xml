<conclusion>
  Estimated value of the Beta coefficients are as below

  Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
  (Intercept) -8.374e+00  3.686e-02  -227.2   less than 2e-16 ***
  installment  5.031e-02  9.733e-05   516.9   less than 2e-16 ***
  loan_amnt   -1.568e-03  2.953e-06  -530.9   less than 2e-16 ***
  term         5.241e-01  8.875e-04   590.5   less than 2e-16 ***

  Also the model F statistic is way larger than the critical value of F statistics.

  Hence we can perform Hypothesis test and if we assume Null hypothesis is the F statistic is not significant we would reject Null hypothesis and conclude that the Model is significant and hence we would conclude that yes there is strong evidence of Linear relationship between interest rate, installment, loan amount and term.
  Iinterest rate can be predicted based on the explanatory variables installment , loan amount and term.
