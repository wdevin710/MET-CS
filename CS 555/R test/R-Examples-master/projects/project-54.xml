<projectDescription>
  In order to study about a given flight in more detailed and to see if it will be delayed has a relationship between the given information of the scheduled departure.
  -	First by build multiple linear regression
  -	Follow the set a hypothesis test - F test
  -	Compare the F- statistics with F = MS reg /MS res, also compare the p-value
  -	Finally, to have a conclusion

<dataDescription>
The airlines dataset has been cleaned and reduce to 399 rows.
The columns that I will use which are Time (duration of flight), Length (distance between airports) and Delay (the number of delay).
</dataDescription>

<researchQuestion>
  Is there a linear relationship between the flight will be delayed and duration of the flight and the distance between airports?
  Preform this test at the alpha = 0.05 level
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
Reject the null hypothesis since F-statistic is 4.832 which greater than 3.018566.
We also have significant evidence at the alpha =0.05 level that beta_time not equal to 0.
There is evidence of a linear association between the delay of flight and Time(duration of flight).
