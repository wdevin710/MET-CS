</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
There is evidence that a student’s college grade point average (GPA) and if they were on a research project gives them a higher chance of being accepted into the graduate school they applied to.
Being a research assistant gives them almost a 4% higher chance of being accepted into the graduate program they applied to.
