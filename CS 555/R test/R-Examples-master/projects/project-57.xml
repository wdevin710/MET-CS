<projectDescription>
For my experiences, we would give tips to the driver when it’s a long drive.
For short distance drive, we and driver may not have a chance to start a conversation, we usually play with my phone and keep doing this till my arrive;
but for long drive, since the ride needs a lot of time, there will be an opportunity to chat with each other. Good mood can lead to the action of paying tips to the driver.
We want to see if there is a relationship with the long trip distance and the action of giving tips.

<dataSource>
Data comes from: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
</dataSource>

<dataDescription>
  We removed other unused columns, and only kept three helpful columns: trip_distance, tip_amount, payment_type.
  First, we have to set up a standard to represent if it’s a long trip. We used “hist()” to see if there was a skewness in this sample data, the graph showed a left skewness; so I used the median instead of the mean. When trip_distance no less than the median, distance_level =1, otherwise distance_level=0.
  When there is an action of paying tips, that is when tip_amount larger than 0, tip_level =1, otherwise tip_level=0.
  We also cleaned all rows which payment_type =2. The data dictionary said when passengers use cash payment, they can’t collect the tip information, so they must be removed.

<researchQuestion>
Perform a logistic regression with the distance of trip as the explanatory variable. We use alpha=0.05 to test that if there is an association between far trip distance and the action of giving tips.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  We can see the p-value is 0.569, much larger than 0.05.
  We don’t have significant evidence at alpha=0.05 to say there is an association between the far trip distance and the action of giving tips.
