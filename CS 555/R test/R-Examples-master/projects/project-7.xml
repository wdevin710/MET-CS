<researchQuestion>
Is there a linear association between the overall player rating in FIFA 19 and the age of the player, use alpha = 0.05?
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
There appears to be a loose linear relationship between age and player performance.
The correlation between age and the overall rating of a player is such that the older a player is the better they can be expected to be.
However, it is not a strong correlation and no causation can be derived from this finding.
Also, since this study was limited to one game and one country, other nationalities and games would need to be included in future studies to get a definitive finding.
