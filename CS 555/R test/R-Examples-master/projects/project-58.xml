  Research topic-Predict whether income exceeds 50K/yr based on census data
  Introduction: An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, etc.
  Methodology: In this project we will be implementing logistic regression to predict if people in the data set belong in a certain class by salary, either making less than 50k or more than 50k per year.

  This dataset was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker  (UCI machine learning repository)
  The dataset is composed of 15 attributes (columns) as follows:

  Continuous attributes: age, fnlwgt(final weight), educational_num (the number of years getting education), capital.gain, capital.loss, hours.per.week
  Categorical attributes:
  workclass: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked

  education: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool
  marital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse

<researchQuestion>
We want to see if attributes are significant to income.
And if it is, we want to study further to predict whether a person has an income of more than 50K a year or not.
This is basically a binary classification problem where a person is classified into the more than 50K group or less than 50K group.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  Confusion Matrix: We can compare our results using a confusion matrix. Since our predictions are predicted probabilities, we specifiy probabilities that are above 50% will be TRUE (above 50K) and anything below or equal to 50% will be FALSE (below 50K)

  Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations. The accuracy of this model is 0.8595745, which is pretty high and accountable.
