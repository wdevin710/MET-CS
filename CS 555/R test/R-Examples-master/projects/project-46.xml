<projectDescription>
  We have data, representing the suicide rate in the world.
  It is based on country, year, sex, age group, GDP.
  Data was collected by UN, WHO and Worlds Bank for the period of 1985-2016 yy.
  We want to analyze the influence of GDP on the suicide rate in a set of western European countries.
  Germany, France and Belgium were chosen for this analysis.
  In this research we will ignore sex and age group breakdown, as we are just interested in economical aspect influence on the suicide rate in western Europe.

<dataDescription>
  Dataset was downloaded from kaggle.com:
  https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016
  After cleaning the dataset we have data just for 3 countries: France, Germany and Belgium. Age groups and sex are removed, dataset is aggregated with mean function to take the average suicide rate between 2 genders and multiple age groups.
  So the columns are: Country, Year, GDP_per_capita(in $1000), Suicide_rate(per 100 000 population).

<researchQuestion>
Is there a linear correlation between GDP per capita and suicide rate in selected countries? If yes, how strong is the correlation. Is it negative or positive?
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  Based on the research I can say that Suicide rate in 3 European countries have linear correlation in the observed period.
  Correlation is medium strong(approximately 60% of suicide rates can be explained by GDP per capita).
  And the correlation is negative, ie when GDP increases, suicide rate decreases.
  Slope of the line is approx. -0.3(sucide rate drops by 0.3 per 100 000 population) on every $1000 GDP per capita increase.
  Intercept is ~29.7, this is a theoretical value of suicide rate when GDP = 0.
