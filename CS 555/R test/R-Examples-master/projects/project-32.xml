<projectDescription>
  We am interested in the association between gender and ticket fare impact on survival of passengers during the titanic mishap.
  This is to analyze during old days if there was an gender and being able to afford high ticket fares on the impacted survival in an adversity.

  The data for this is obtained from https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets/tree/master/Datasets

  The data set chosen has details on the passengers who survived/not survived during the titanic incident.

  The columns of interest in the dataset are as follows
  Survived – a Boolean indicating survival from Titanic incident. 1-survived and 0-not survived.
  Sex – Gender of the survivor
  Fare – Ticket fare paid by the passenger
  Gender – dummy variable created from Sex with 0-male and 1-female

<researchQuestion>
  Determine if gender and Fare or just one of these parameters impacted the survival rate of passengers in the Titanic incident. Assume alpha = 0.05.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  From the collected sample, there is evidence of association between gender and survival in the titanic incident after adjusting for Fare.
  The odds ratio of survival is higher (Odds ratio = 13.61) for female vs male after adjusting for Fare.
  There is also evidence of association between Fare and survival in the titanic incident after adjusting for Gender.
  The odds ratio of survival is 1.01 for every 1 unit increase in Fare after adjusting for Gender.
  As a statistician, we can see that the model fits multiple logistic regression.
