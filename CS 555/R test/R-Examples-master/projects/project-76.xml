<projectDescription>
From the dataset of titanic, we can see personal information about the passengers, the financial and physical situation of the ship.
As there’re three levels of class in the ship(the highest, the medium, the lowest), the passengers paid different amount of fare to book these three classes.
In general, people have to pay more as the class get upgrade, but in titanic does the fare vary by the passenger class significantly?

<researchQuestion>
  Does the Fare vary by the Pclass?
  Perform a one-way anova using the aov or anova function in R to access.

<conclusion>
From that, we have significant evidence α=0.05 level that there is a difference in fare between class2 and class1.
Also, we have significant evidence α=0.05 level that there is a difference in fare between class3 and class1. 
However, we don’t have significant evidence alpha = 0.05 level that there is a difference in fare between class2 and class3.
