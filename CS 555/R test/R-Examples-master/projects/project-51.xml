<researchQuestion>
  1.	If the student’s parents have good degrees, do they have same math scores?
  2.	What is the risk difference between prepared or unprepared for getting higher math scores?
  3.	Comparing lunch and gender, which is a better influence for the student’s math scores?
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
It is not surprised that there are a couple of factors affecting students’ math scores.
Apparently, the parental level of education is one of the key causes to impact the math score.
Education is really a big problem for many students and families. A higher math score is not guaranteed to decide the future of a student, but it can reflect how much you have learned from the class.
A good family education background is more likely to make a student study better.
