<researchQuestion>
Are the students that are good at math will be also good at reading? Is there any linear regression between them?
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  Since the Beta1 is 0.78723 which in close to 1(meaning that the score of math and the score of reading have a strong relationship), and also according to the graph, we could conclude that there is a linear regression relation between math.score and reading.score.
  When the score of math increase, the score of reading is also increasing.
