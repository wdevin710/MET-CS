<researchQuestion>
  Does airplane server time per week has a positive relationship with its delay?
  Does airplane’s company has a relationship with its delay?
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  By the cor value:-0.11 the server time and Delay has no significant relationship.

  By the summary, we can clear see that the Airline name: ”AS” server the most little time.
  The “F9” and “WN”’s server time is a const number. Never change.
  The AS, YV delay every time and F9 never delay.
  The F value is not big enough to support that Time is diff between different Airline.
