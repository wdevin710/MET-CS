<projectDescription>
The data set we find is about the earthquakes which happened in the turkey.
The data set includes city, direction, distance and depth, totally four four columns.
This time, we want to test the relationship between column distance and depth.
</projectDescription>

<dataDescription>
There are totally four columns in the dataset.
The first one is city, which represents where the earthquake happened.
The second one is direction, it shows in which part the earthquake happened in the city.
The third one is distance, which shows the distance of the earthquake.
The last one is depth, which means the depth of the earthquake.

<researchQuestion>
Calculate the ANOVA table and the table which gives the standard error of  1.
Formally test the hypothesis that beta_1 = 0 using either the F-test or the t-test at the alpha level α=0.10.
Calculate the R2.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  From the test below, we know that t-value = 2.047 > 1.648.
  So we have significant evidence at the alpha = 0.1 level that beta_1 ≠0, besides, beta_1 means the slope (the expected change in y for each one-unit change in x).
  And we know that R2 = 0.008362257, which means the quantity that represents the proportion of the variation explained by the regression.
