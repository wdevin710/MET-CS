<researchQuestion>
  Our primary area of concern pertains to whether race/ethnicity plays a significant role in the decedents death.
  We hope to understand if there are larger number of deaths for different ethnicityâ€™s which would warrant additional research in to this particular subject matter.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  From the above plots, and the F test, we have significance evidence at the alpha = 0.05, that there are at least two races with different number of mean deaths

  Based on the pairwise test results,
  We can say that we do not have sufficient evidence that mean deaths are different between the following pair of races:
  Not Stated/Unknown - Asian and Pacific Islander
  Other Race/ Ethnicity - Asian and Pacific Islander
  White Non-Hispanic - Asian and Pacific Islander
  Other Race/ Ethnicity - Not Stated/Unknown
  White Non-Hispanic - Not Stated/Unknown
  White Non-Hispanic - Asian and Pacific Islander

  And we can conclude for all other pairs that the mean deaths is different.s
