</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  a) Relationship between age and spending score
  From the scatterplot, we can know that spending score is negatively correlated with age. However, the correlation is 0.33, which means the strength of the association between the variables is not very strong.
  b) Relationship between annual income and spending score
  The spending score is not associated with annual income. It shows that people with middle income usually have mediocre pending score while for high and low income level people have either high or low spending score.
  c) Relationship between gender and spending score
  Also, we could know that there is no difference for males and females in terms of spending.
