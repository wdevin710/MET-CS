<projectDescription>
Nowadays airplane become more and more popular, so that people always choose airplane as transportation tool.
It is really annoying that plane got delayed when you are waiting in airport. 
We are interested in using flight scheduled departure data to predict whether a given flight will be delayed.
There are many factors that influence the arrival time.
In this task we would use data set with 8 variables to build a logistic regression model in order to predict delay.

<dataDescription>
  Airlines Dataset Inspired in the regression dataset from Elena Ikonomovska. 
  The task is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure. 
  This data set contain 8 variables (Airline, Flight, AirportFrom, AirportTo, DayOfWeek, Time, Length, Delay). This data has no missing value. 
  We are using DayOfWeek, Time, Length to build a logistic regression model to predicting the delay.
  DayOfWeek: Use number represent the flight depart. (Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2â€¦)
  Time: Actual elapsed time.
  Length: Distance.

<researchQuestion>
  We are interested in using flight scheduled departure data to predict whether a given flight will be delayed. 
  In this task we would use data set with 8 variables to build a logistic regression module in order to predict delay.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
The test result shows there are association between delay and DayOfWeek, Time and Length.
The model we build has an accuracy about 60% which is good.
We can add more variables into the model to increase the accuracy.
