<projectDescription>
The sinking of the Titanic was a shocking shipwreck, there are only a few people survived.
A husband is not sure whether his wife survived in this accident, and we want to help him to compute the rate of his 25-year-old wife survived in this accident.
So, We wonder whether there is any relationship between sex and age of the people and whether people survived in Titanic accident.
We also want to predict the chance of survived in shipwreck through sex and age of the person. We also want to whether our prediction is accurate.

<dataDescription>
  After clean up our data, there are three columns in the dataset (sex, age and whether people survived).
  In the column of survived, we use 1 to represent survival and 0 to represent dead.
  There are 188 women and 143 of them survived. There are 312 men and 64 of them survived.
</dataDescription>

<researchQuestion>
We want to test (at the alpha = 0.05 level) whether the proportion of people survived is the same across men and women, predict the rate of surviving for 35 women and compute ROC of the prediction model.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  We 99.5% confident that sex will influence the rate of survived, female will have a greater chance to survive in Titanic accident.
  (Because the p-value of the test between sex and whether people survived is very small, and z value =sqrt(x-squared)=12.73, which is greater than z value (1.96) at 0.05 level)

  the rate of surviving for 25-years-old women is 0.789

  Our prediction is middle precision (ROC=0.7815 and 0.631 . 0.78158 and 0.631 is greater than 0.5, but these are not a very big number between 0 to 1)
