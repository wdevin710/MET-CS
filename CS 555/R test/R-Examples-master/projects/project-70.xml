<dataDescription>
  The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.
  The parameters included are :
  1. GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
  2. TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
  3. University Rating ( out of 5 )
  4. Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
  5. Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
  6. Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
  7. Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )
  For my project, I will focus on the attribute 1, 2, 3 and 5.

<researchQuestion>
With the alpha = 0.05 level, will there be a multiple linear regression relationship between GRE, TOEFL, University Rank and Undergraduate GPA to the Admit Chance?
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
According to the multiple linear regression model, we got a very small p-value which means there are strong evidence that there is a strong linear relationship between the selected attributes and the admit chance at the alpha = 0.05 level.
And according to the coefficients, Undergraduate GPA is the most important element for enrollment to a Master Program.
As the GPA increased 1, there is 13.3% chance of admit increased.
