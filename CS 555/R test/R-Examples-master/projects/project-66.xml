<projectDescription>
  Describe your research scenario in no more than 200 words.
  This is a general description of the use case. Similar to our class examples, we first describe the overall scenario and then we specify a specific research question based on it.
  Through using the aov function in R to analyze the data and summarize the results by the 5 step procedure.
  If the overall results are significant, then perform the appropriate pairwise comparisons using Tukeyâ€™s procedure to adjust for multiple comparison.

<dataDescription>
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. There are 17 columns in the data set, including age, job, martial, education, balance etc.
Since we only use balance and education for this project, I remove some columns in order to make it clearer.

<researchQuestion>
  By using ANOVA and pairwise comparison to compare data across multiple groups (education
  level in this case), we will test the null hypothesis that the underlying population means are all
  equal versus the alternative that at least two of the underlying population means differ.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
  In this data set, we know that there is a difference in average yearly balance among people who have different education degree.
  To understand which exact group it is, we use pairwise comparison and find out it is tertiary and secondary education level has significant difference in average yearly balance.
