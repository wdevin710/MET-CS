<projectDescription>
In our dataset, we have the wage of the soccer players, the value of the soccer players and age of the soccer players.
To find out if there is a linear relationship between the wage and their age and their value, we select 500 players to do the research.
These 500 players are randomly selected from top 10000 soccer players around the world.
By a set of calculation, we found that the average and deviation of age is 27.192 and 3.626;
the average and deviation of wage is 93192 and 76441.81;
the average and deviation of value is 27.026M and 16.5147.

<dataDescription>
  We use three attributes to achieve my analysis job, the first one is the response variable â€“ the wage of the soccer players, this is the annual salary of a soccer;
  the second variable is an explanatory variable named value, the value of a soccer player is the estimate of the overall ability in Fifa 19 soccer game, the more value a soccer player has, the more he can contribute to his team; the third variable is also an explanatory variable which is the age of soccer players.
  Actually, there are many other variables in this dataset, thus we need to remove these variables manually, after doing this, the number of variables is reduced from 14 to 4.

<researchQuestion>
To find out if there is a linear relationship between the wage and their age and their value, Perform this test at the alpha =0.01 level.
</researchQuestion>

<conclusion>
We use qf function in R, we can calculate the F-distribution with 2, 497 degrees of freedom and associated with alpha = 0.01, the result is 4.65.
Since the F statistic is 0.6251, lower than 4.65, we can conclude that we do not have sufficient evidence at 0.01 level, Beta(age) != 0 or Beta(Value) != 0.
There is no evidence of a linear association between annual salary and age and/or value.
